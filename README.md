🏠 House Value Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices using various regression models on the California Housing dataset. It includes end-to-end implementation from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, and finally deploying the model using XGBoost for future use.

📌 Project Description

This notebook demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow to:

Load and explore data
Preprocess and normalize features
Train and compare multiple regression models
Evaluate performance using standard metrics
Export the best model using XGBoost

📂 Dataset

The project uses the California Housing Dataset, which is included in sklearn.datasets. It contains information collected from the 1990 California census, including:

Median income
House age
Average number of rooms/bedrooms
Population
Median house value (target)
